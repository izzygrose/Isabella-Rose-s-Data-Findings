        <h1>The Risk of Intervention</h1>

        <p class="dek">Cleveland Crisis Intervention data showed in 2023 that when a Crisis Intervention Team Officer is called to respond to an event there is a high chance that an individual involved in the event is injured due to force. </p>

        <p>Data shows nearly a 70% chance of injury when CIT officers are on the scene in 2023.</p>

        <p>Crisis intervention officers are meant to de-escalate encounters between the police and people in crisis. The team of Crisis Intervention officers spend 40 hours training to learn how to respond to suicides threats, domestic violence, assault, and many other crises.</p>

        <p>“It's hard work. It’s the other side of police that people don’t see,” said Detective Niccolo Angelino of the Cleveland Police Department.</p>

        <p>In the 40 hours of training officers have to go through, they learn how to interact and identify those with mental illnesses or addictions. Then they learn about the different systems and types of health care that they can recommend to individuals.</p>


        <p>CIT officers in training learn about ways to reduce the use of force when they arrive in a crisis situation. With reducing the use of force, it reduces the amount of injuries to either officers or individuals involved in the situation. </p>

        <p>Officers also learn how to improve relationships with the community by creating better well timed and appropriate intervention. They learn to carry out better treatment for individuals involved.</p>

        <p>In 2024, Cleveland, Ohio has been working hard to create more programs and training to help officers be ready for specialized calls regarding crisis intervention. </p>

        <p>As of May 2024, the City of Cleveland released a dataset from the past year regarding 911 calls that have made it to the Cleveland Crisis Intervention Team.</p>

        <p>In this data, there is nearly 70% chance of injury due to force for individuals when a Crisis Intervention Team is called, Cleveland has proposed a new law that would send clinicians to the scene of a crisis instead of police.</p

        <p>The law that Cleveland looks to implement would be called “Tanisha’s Law.” It is named after Tanisha Anderson, a woman with a mental illness that died back in 2014 while the Cleveland police held her in custody, said Courtney Astolfi, writer for cleveland.com.</p>

        <p>Her family met with Case Western Reserve University law students to write what is not the proposed “Tanisha’s Law” to prevent another death in crisis situations that involve police.</p>

        <p>The law would require in crisis situations to have two different types of responses.</p>

        <p>One would mean that no police would be on the scene, non-police. On the scene, there would only be health officials. The second one, limited-police response, would have a health specialist on the scene and specifically trained police.</p>

        <p>The goal of the proposed “Tanisha’s Law” is that with clinicians on the scene, individuals involved in a crisis situation will receive immediate medical help regarding their mental health. The individuals will be less likely to encounter injuries or be able to hurt police officers.</p>

        <p>Along with the increased chance of injury for individuals, it is more likely for officers to use lower levels of force when there is a specialist CIT officer on the scene.</p>

        <p><iframe title="It is more likely for officers to use levels 1 and 2 of force when there is a specialist CIT officer on the scene" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-NpKBo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NpKBo/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="260" data-external="1"></iframe></p>

        <p>When CIT officers have to use force at a crisis scene, it is more likely that they use levels one and two types of force. The level of force system starts with no force used at all, then proceeds to level one use of force, which means force is very limited. Next, is level two use of force. This is a middling point of force between very little and then the highest use of force, level three.</p>

        <p>In the Cleveland Crisis Intervention Team dataset from 2023, using column statistics, the percentage of level one force was 60% with a CIT officer on the scene. The level two use of force had nearly a 65% chance when a CIT officer was on the scene.</p>

        <p>There was about a 43% chance of CIT officers using no force when on the scene, but a 50% chance of CIT officers using level three use of force.</p>

        <p>With the use of force levels staying between level one and level two, the CIT officers are able to keep the crisis scene from escalating.</p>

        <p>In regards to the amount of officers who are CIT certified, the Cleveland Police Department has 116 officers. The department has planned for a few more certification training weeks for officers who want to receive more specialized training on the issues of mental health and crisis intervention.</p>

        <p>To receive CIT training officers can go to one of three different places in and around Cleveland, Ohio. They can go to the Tri-C public training center, the Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services’ Board of Education and Training Department, and Northeast Ohio Medical University.</p>

        <p>The ADAMHS Board of Education and Training Department will provide free training, and the other options may provide a possible reimbursement for participating in the training and being willing to add to the number of officers who are certified.</p>
